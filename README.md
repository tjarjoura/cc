A simple C Compiler written in Go. The current plan is to only target amd64/x86_64 binaries for the Linux operating system.

My motivation for writing this is to learn more about compilers, assembly language, and the x86_64/amd64 ABI on Linux. I also wanted a chance to work on a larger project in Go.
